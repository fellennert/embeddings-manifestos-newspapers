TODO

- [x] Try agglomative clustering to reduce the number of topics  
-> Done. Works much better than the built-in one (method="complete", metric="cosine")
- [x] Try year by year   
  1. Clustering on all corpus and PCA year by year. Works well except for 2002
  2. Clustering year by year. Bad clusters becasue too few data.
- [ ] Try BERTopic  
- [ ] Read the article about Microframes
